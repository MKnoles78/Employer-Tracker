# Employer-Tracker


## Description 

This is a CLI that takes in user input through node to create and maintain an employee database.  The user is first prompted with questions on what they would like to do by utilizing the npm inquirer. The user follows the prompts to view employees, add employees, and remove employees from the roster. The user should be able to perform the following:

 * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.
